\section{Introduction}

We may use statistics to understand binomial events that are models where
two alternatives are presented, option A or option B.

Some common binomial models can be, being born a female or male, having or not an specif genetic trait,
or even a success or failure on the toss of a coin or dice, which can usually
be simulated with the generation of a random number (equivalent of the toss of a dice in the discrete universe)
and then check it against a threashold that would define it as being
option A or B, or success or failure if you will.

An example would be the toss of a $20$ sided dice and set the threashold as $10$ so any value higher
than that is considered a success giving us a $50\%$ success rate.

In order to simulate this toss, we use a square probability distribuited (fig \ref{intro:squared}) number generator
and then, use that result as a success/failure result (compared with a success threashold).
By repeating the procediment, we can have a success rate which follows the normal or gaussian
distribuition (fig \ref{intro:binomial}).

The normal or gaussian probability distribuirion dictates a probability has it's peak at the
average $<%= @gaussian.average %>$ and having the distribuition dropping on the edges, but
never being zero (non probable events have a minor chance of happening).

\begin{equation}
<%= @gaussian %>

One way to have a normal (gaussian) distribuition random number generator, is to also generate several random numbers
and calculate their average threating this final number as the random number.
